# About

__BibLogos helps groups of people to collectively work on distilling facts out of books and provide that as a dataset.__ 

It does this by a process where everybody can create book markings with meaning and ask for their work to be integrated into the various datasets.
Those markings are then provided as RDF data with references back to the source book. 

### Imagine:
- Asking the Bible every city where Jesus healed the sick.
- Getting all the alternative names of Jesus.
- Find every parable in a book.
