__BibLogos helps groups of people to collectively work on distilling facts out of books and provide that as a dataset.__ 

It does this by a process where everybody can create book markings with meaning and ask for their work to be integrated into a dataset.
Those markings are then provided as RDF data with references back to the source book. 

### Find answers to questions like:
- In which cities did Jesus heal the sick.
- What are the alternative names of Jesus.
- Which parables do exist.
