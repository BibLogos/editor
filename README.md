# BibLogos Editor

- What if you could ask things to the Bible? 
- In which cities has Jesus been with his disciples? 
- Who has seen Paul?

This editor helps with creating a dataset that may present those facts. It is mainly based on human work. A person can login and click on words or sentences in the bible text and link that to a corresponding description of it. For example you can click on "Alternative name" or "Person".
